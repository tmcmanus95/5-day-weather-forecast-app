# 5-day-weather-forecast-app

This vanilla JavaScript app uses the Openweather API to search 5 day weather forecasts by city.

# Description

This app uses vanilla JavaScript to render a 5 day weather forecast based on data provided by the Openweather API. It then displays that city's next 5 days of weather including information temperature, humidity, wind speed, as well as a general description for each day and an accompanying icon.

To use this app, type in the name of a city and click search. You can also click on the past searched cities to search that city again.
